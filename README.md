A server that acts as middle hand for manifest and segment requests, with the ability of adding corruptions to the manifest file, or messing with segment requests.

It parses the query parameters from the request and applies corruptions as specified.

Currently supported stream formats:

- HLS
- MPEG-DASH (MPD)

If you want to try it out you can sign up for an account at [Eyevinn Open Source Cloud](https://www.osaas.io).

## Get Started

Requires `NodeJS` v14+ and `npm`

### For Development

`npm install` installs dependencies.

`npm run dev` starts the server on port `8000`.

Run on a custom port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

To try it out, go to your favourite HLS/MPEG-DASH video player such as `https://web.player.eyevinn.technology/index.html` and paste the proxied URL. For example, if the source / original manifest is located at: `https://maitv-vod.lab.eyevinn.technology/VINN.mp4/master.m3u8` the proxied URL is `http://localhost:8000/api/v2/manifests/hls/proxy-master.m3u8?url=https://maitv-vod.lab.eyevinn.technology/VINN.mp4/master.m3u8`.

### Query Parameters

| PARAMETER    | DESCRIPTION                                                                               |

### Stateful Mode

By settings the `STATEFUL` env variable to `true`, stateful mode can be enabled, in this mode certain additional features are enabled at the cost of keeping some state in-memory. The state cache TTL Ã­n seconds can be configured with the `TTL` env variable, default of 300 seconds.

Currently the only feature not available when running in stateless mode is relative sequence numbers on HLS livestreams.

### Load Manifest url params from AWS SSM parameter store instead

- Create a .env file at the root the of project
- fill it like this :

```
AWS_REGION="eu-central-1"
AWS_SSM_PARAM_KEY="/ChaosStreamProxy/Development/UrlParams"
LOAD_PARAMS_FROM_AWS_SSM=true
```

- on AWS SSM, create a parameter with name : <em>/ChaosStreamProxy/Development/UrlParams</em>
- add a value for corruptions, for example : <em>&statusCode=[{i:3,code:500},{i:4,code:500}]</em>

## Corruptions

Currently, the Chaos Stream Proxy supports 4 types of corruptions for HLS and MPEG-DASH streams. These corruptions may be used in combination with one another.

### Specifying Corruption Configurations

To specify the configurations for a particular corruption, you will need to add a stringified JSON object as a query parameter to the proxied URL.
Each corruption has a unique configuration JSON object template. Each object can be used to target one specific segment for corruption.
e.i. `https://<chaos-proxy>/api/v2/manifests/hls/proxy-master.m3u8?url=<some_url>&some_corruption=[{i:0},{i:1},{i:2}, ... ,{i:N}]`

Across all corruptions, there are 3 ways to target a segment in a playlist for corruption.

1. `i`: The segment's list index in any Media Playlist, with HLS segments starting at 0 and MPEG-DASH segments starting at 1. For a Media Playlist with 12 segments, `i`=11, would target the last segment for HLS and `i`=12, would target the last segment for MPEG-DASH.
2. `sq`: The segment's Media Sequence Number for HLS, or the "$Number$" or "$Time$" part of a segment URL for DASH. For an HLS Media Playlist with 12 segments, and where `#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE` is 100, `sq`=111 would target the last segment. When corrupting a live HLS or DASH stream it is recommended to target with `rsq`.
3. `rsq`: A relative sequence number, counted from where the live stream is currently at when requesting manifest. Can also use a negative integer, which enables counting backwards from the end of the manifest instead. (**SUPPORTED ONLY IN STATEFUL MODE FOR BOTH HLS AND DASH**)

Below are configuration JSON object templates for the currently supported corruptions. A query should have its value be an array consisting of any one of these 3 types of items:

Delay Corruption:

```typescript
{
    i?: number | "*",  // index of target segment in playlist. If "*", then target all segments. (Starts on 0 for HLS / 1 for MPEG-DASH)
    l?: number | "*",  // index of ABR rung to delay media playlist. (Starts on 1 and only applicable to HLS)
    sq?: number | "*", // media sequence number of target segment in playlist. If "*", then target all segments
    rsq?: number,      // relative sequence number from where a livestream is currently at
    ms?: number,       // time to delay in milliseconds
    br?: number | number[] | "*", // apply only to specific or an array of specific bitrates
}
```

Status Code Corruption:

```typescript
{
    i?: number | "*",  // index of target segment in playlist. If "*", then target all segments. (Starts on 0 for HLS / 1 for MPEG-DASH)
    sq?: number | "*", // media sequence number of target segment in playlist. If "*", then target all segments
    rsq?: number,      // relative sequence number from where a livestream is currently at
    code?: number,     // code to return in http response status header instead of media file
    br?: number | number[] | "*", // apply only to specific or an array of specific bitrates
}
```

Timeout Corruption:

```typescript
{
    i?: number | "*",  // index of target segment in playlist. If "*", then target all segments. (Starts on 0 for HLS / 1 for MPEG-DASH)
    sq?: number | "*", // media sequence number of target segment in playlist. If "*", then target all segments
    rsq?: number,      // relative sequence number from where a livestream is currently at
    br?: number | number[] | "*", // apply only to specific or an array of specific bitrates
}
```

Throttle Corruption:

```typescript
{
    i?: number | "*",  // index of target segment in playlist. If "*", then target all segments. (Starts on 0 for HLS / 1 for MPEG-DASH)
    sq?: number | "*", // media sequence number of target segment in playlist. If "*", then target all segments
    rsq?: number,      // relative sequence number from where a livestream is currently at
    br?: number | number[] | "*", // apply only to specific or an array of specific bitrates
    rate?: number      // rate in bytes per second to limit the segment download speed to
}
```

One can either target a segment through the index parameter, `i`, or the sequence number parameter, `sq`, relative sequence numbers, `rsq`, are translated to sequence numbers, . In the case where one has entered both, the **index parameter** will take precedence.

Relative sequence numbers, `rsq`, are translated to sequence numbers, `sq`, and will thus override any provided `sq`.

When targeting all segments through the input value of `"*"`, it is possible to **untarget** a specific segment by including a JSON item with only either `i` or `sq` in the corruption array, see example corruption #4.

```

7. LIVE: Example of MPEG-DASH with a segment delay of 5000ms on segment with relative sequence number equal to 2:

```
https://<chaos-proxy>/api/v2/manifests/dash/proxy-master.mpd?url=https://livesim.dashif.org/livesim/testpic_2s/Manifest.mpd&delay=[{rsq:2, ms:5000}]
```
